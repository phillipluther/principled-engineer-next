    <p> My name is Phillip Luther. I go by Phil.</p>

    <p>
      I'm a life-long<sup>*</sup> software engineer and classically trained musician. I'm also the
      creator of and sole contributor to the Principled Engineer, this very blog.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blog-relevant areas of current interest include the web audio API, non-crypto blockchain
      technology, and legislative overreactions to dark patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blog-irrelevant areas of current interest include sci-fi/fantasy across most mediums,
      micro-optimizing my living space, and trying to reconcile my love of strong drink with a
      desire to live a yogic lifestyle.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.finePrint}>
      <sup>*</sup> I'm just over 40. Accounting for childhood and teenage buffoonery I'll translate
      "life long" to 20'ish years. Throwing that out for clarity.
